How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
-It made it easier to find what was different from what was existing (and working).
-It helped in finding the error without having to go through each and every line of the new file.
-If you feel that the old version looks better than the new version, you can always go back.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
-It helps you have access to previous versions that are working. 
-In the event of a failure/loss of the present version, all is not lost. You'll have something to work with.
-It helps in debugging, without having to go through each and every line of the code.
-It helps in making modifications to the older versions easier.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros:
-you have control over when to have a version saved instead of cluttering the system with too many autosaves.
-you can assign commits based on logical changes instead of plain autosave.
-you can directly go to a previous version without having to search for which auto-saved version to look for.

cons:
-If you forget to save, you might lose the code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-because they don't require multiple files to function 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-'git log' to view the history of commits
-'git diff' to see the changes made in the file between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
-we can always restore to a previous version that's working and known
-we have the changes tracked for each commit, so we can add or remove any feature/functionality without 
 fear of removing any existing ones

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
-try on source code from from github or other web pages
